Me: Not sure if I should feel great about today. I did some stuff that allowed me to understand better pointers and bitwise. But that was only the 2.1 session of CSAPP. But I did put 3~4 hours of work on this... Hard to know if my performance was so crap that I should feel good about. But feeling bad about will fuck you hard. Figure it out!!!! I think that reading a full chapter of a book is kind unrealistic. My neck "pain" is unfortunally returning back and I'm not sure what to do about it. And maybe I also did messed up my sleep cycle a bit again.</br></br>

Also, this makes sense: </br></br>

- JBlow on cranking:</br></br>

A Crank Session is a period of intense work focused on producing the highest-quality result. I will start a timer, and for 3 hours, will be working with the most focus that I can on this day at this time. I won't be reading chat, stopping to hang out, or anything else distractionary, until the timer finishes. In fact I won't leave the chair for any reason. I will leave the mic on and occasionally explain what I am doing, but, if that takes too much energy, I will stop and focus on the programming. My secondary monitor will be off. If the stream goes down, I won't know until the time is up.</br></br>

Also, try to undestend this piece of code made by him: 

<FONT COLOR=GREEN><PRE>
#include stdlib.h

struct S {
    char *name;
    int trailing_count;
    int trailing[0];
};
    
S *test_me() {
    const int N = 10;
    S *s = (S *)malloc(sizeof(S) + N * sizeof(int));
    s->trailing_count = N;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) s->trailing[i] = i;

    return s;
}

- CMuratori on impostor syndrome:</br></br>

Programming is hard for everyone, even for people with 30+ years like him. </br>
Persist and work hard, consistly, and you will get better at it. </br>
It's very easy to be to harsh on yourself, other good people has flaws. </br>
Things that makes you good at programming: being able to the math needed, perseverance, understand hard, keep system in your head (how to improve it)...</br>
If you take too long to find out about a bug, try to understand why and improve it.</br>
Are you really willing to become a good programmer? Put the work on it.</br>
Sometimes you won't be good at something right away, but the time you take makes you understand it more deeply.</br>
Writing programs that are complete and works well already puts you in a good category of programmers.</br>
Finish the project even if it is bad. </br>
Try to do something like a Asteroid game clone from strach, figure it out why you can't do it (sometimes is just lack of perseverance).</br>
The only way of spitting flawless code first try on the text editor is having done it shortly before or 100+ times, on Handmade Hero he have look up for stuff all the time. Continue to Handmade Chat 012.. about 40:00 mark time. </br></br>

- Me:</br></br>

What I want is to become a programmer, math is super important, but secondary. The main focus of my study is programming, and I will only divert from that if the programming thing I need to do requires some math/theorical cs/whatver. Doing that will be more motivated then just skimming through crypitical math books. Of course, math requires sophistication and I need to aquire it, but programming first! Keep reading CS:APP your priority for the next few days, don't read other stuff. Look up for math on the internet if you need to.</br></br>

Also, I need keep it up with my 11:00pm ~ 07:00am sleep cycles, I think that will be starting seeing the results soon. Remember to turn off machines 10:30pm and eat healtly. Remember that bad sleep has beeing the number one reason why I feel miserable, eating badly and lack of exercicing being seconds. Try to do the crank thing that JBlow mentioned.
