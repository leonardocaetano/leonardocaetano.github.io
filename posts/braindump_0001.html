Me: Not sure if I should feel great about today. I did some stuff that allowed me to understand better pointers and bitwise. But that was only the 2.1 session of CSAPP. But I did put 3~4 hours of work on this... Hard to know if my performance was so crap that I shouldn't feel good about. But feeling bad about will fuck you hard. Figure it out!!!! I think that reading a full chapter of a book is kind unrealistic. My neck "pain" is unfortunally returning back and I'm not sure what to do about it. And maybe I also did messed up my sleep cycle a bit again.</br></br>

Also, I shouldn't be so frustaded when I get stuck. I get really depressed and upset about... This is bad and I need to change that, just be more neutral about it and don't give that much importance about your feelings, they are just feelings. </br></br>
Also, set up yourself to do 2-four hours crank sessions. Eat healtly prior and don't drink too much water before it. Zero distraction on that time!!!!!</br></br>
Also, this makes sense: </br></br>

- Also look at "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering" by Hamming, its a Carmack recommendation

papa rudin or real analysis by royden

notes: 
- math is hard and you will get stuck.
- you WILL get stuck
- you don't need to MASTER every one of these books
- you need time to process math ideas

quote:

- as von neumann said, “math isn’t something to understand, it’s something to get used to” or something along the lines of that. (you kinda get the point)



tips (to learn at my own): 
- decide what you want to learn
- you can go into a advanced subject, you just won't learn every thing at first
- doing that, you won't feel defeated or stupid or a failure, and that's important
- paul halmos said that when he was learning, he gathered as many books as possible, did as many problems as possible
- watch videos (less gooder then books)

===========================================

como ficar bom em math, programming e problem solving

EXPERIENCE

to get experience, you need two things: pratice and time

time to absorve things and let it sink in. reflect about it

- JBlow on cranking:</br></br>

A Crank Session is a period of intense work focused on producing the highest-quality result. I will start a timer, and for 3 hours, will be working with the most focus that I can on this day at this time. I won't be reading chat, stopping to hang out, or anything else distractionary, until the timer finishes. In fact I won't leave the chair for any reason. I will leave the mic on and occasionally explain what I am doing, but, if that takes too much energy, I will stop and focus on the programming. My secondary monitor will be off. If the stream goes down, I won't know until the time is up.</br></br>

Also, try to undestend this piece of code made by him: 

<FONT COLOR=GREEN><PRE>
#include stdlib.h

struct S {
    char *name;
    int trailing_count;
    int trailing[0];
};
    
S *test_me() {
    const int N = 10;
    S *s = (S *)malloc(sizeof(S) + N * sizeof(int));
    s->trailing_count = N;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) s->trailing[i] = i;

    return s;
}

- CMuratori on impostor syndrome:</br></br>

Programming is hard for everyone, even for people with 30+ years like him. </br>
Persist and work hard, consistly, and you will get better at it. </br>
It's very easy to be to harsh on yourself, other good people has flaws. </br>
Things that makes you good at programming: being able to the math needed, perseverance, understand hard, keep system in your head (how to improve it)...</br>
If you take too long to find out about a bug, try to understand why and improve it.</br>
Are you really willing to become a good programmer? Put the work on it.</br>
Sometimes you won't be good at something right away, but the time you take makes you understand it more deeply.</br>
Writing programs that are complete and works well already puts you in a good category of programmers.</br>
Finish the project even if it is bad. </br>
Try to do something like a Asteroid game clone from strach, figure it out why you can't do it (sometimes is just lack of perseverance).</br>
The only way of spitting flawless code first try on the text editor is having done it shortly before or 100+ times, on Handmade Hero he have look up for stuff all the time.</br> Continue to Handmade Chat 012.. about 40:00 mark time. </br></br>

- Me:</br></br>

What I want is to become a programmer, math is super important, but secondary. The main focus of my study is programming, and I will only divert from that if the programming thing I need to do requires some math/theorical cs/whatver. Doing that will be more motivated then just skimming through crypitical math books. Of course, math requires sophistication and I need to aquire it, but programming first! Keep reading CS:APP your priority for the next few days, don't read other stuff. Look up for math on the internet if you need to.</br></br>

Also, I need keep it up with my 11:00pm ~ 07:00am sleep cycles, I think that will be starting seeing the results soon. Remember to turn off machines 10:30pm and eat healtly. Remember that bad sleep has beeing the number one reason why I feel miserable, eating badly and lack of exercicing being seconds. Try to do the crank thing that JBlow mentioned.
